          Machu Picchu is an ancient Inca citadel located high in the Andes
          Mountains of Peru, at an altitude of about 2,430 meters (7,970 feet)
          above sea level. It was built in the 15th century during the reign of
          Inca emperor Pachacuti, and its purpose remains a subject of
          speculationâ€”though it is believed to have been a royal estate or
          religious site. The site was abandoned in the 16th century during the
          Spanish Conquest and remained largely forgotten by the outside world
          until its rediscovery by American historian Hiram Bingham in
          1911.Machu Picchu is renowned for its advanced dry-stone construction,
          precise stonework, and sophisticated agricultural terraces. It is
          divided into two main areas: the agricultural sector with terraced
          fields and the urban sector, which includes temples, plazas, and
          residential buildings. The most famous structure within the site is
          the **Intihuatana** stone, often called the "hitching post of the
          sun," which is believed to have been used for astronomical
          purposes.Today, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one
          of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. It is accessible
          by a combination of train, bus, and hiking, including the renowned
          Inca Trail. The site remains a symbol of the Inca Empire and is a
          testament to its remarkable engineering and cultural achievements.
